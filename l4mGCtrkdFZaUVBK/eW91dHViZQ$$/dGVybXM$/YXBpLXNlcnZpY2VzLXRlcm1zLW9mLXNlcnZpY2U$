    <h2 id="indemnification" style="display: none">21. Indemnification</h2>
    <p><b>Indemnification.</b> You will indemnify, defend (at YouTube’s option) and hold YouTube, its Affiliates, and Related Parties harmless against any claim, costs, losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, fees (including reasonable fees of attorneys and other professionals), and expenses arising out of or in connection with any claim, action or proceeding (any and all of which are "<b>Claims</b>") by a third party arising out of (i) access to, or any use of any YouTube API Services by you, those acting on your behalf, your API Client(s), or any of your users; (ii) actual or alleged violation of the Agreement (or any portion thereof) by you, those acting on your behalf, your API Client(s), or any of your users, including actual or alleged infringement of any third-party right (including any intellectual property or other proprietary right, confidentiality, privacy right, or right of publicity) by you, those acting on your behalf, your API Client(s), or any of your users; or (iii) any content, data, technology or materials provided or contributed by, or through, you, those acting on your behalf, your API Client(s), or any of your users, and not by YouTube, its Affiliates and Related Parties.</p>

    <p><b>Injunctive Relief.</b> You acknowledge that the limitations and restrictions in the Agreement are necessary and reasonable to protect YouTube, and expressly agree that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for your breach of the Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, should YouTube or Google Inc. first file a patent infringement claim in a lawsuit against you (excluding a patent infringement claim brought by YouTube or Google Inc. in response to a lawsuit, for example, as a cross-claim or counterclaim), then the non-assert provision in the first sentence of this Section will be suspended only for the duration of YouTube’s or Google Inc’s first patent infringement claim against you (for example, until such patent infringement claim is settled, withdrawn, dismissed, or otherwise disposed of).</p>

  <li id="termination">
    <h2 id="termination" style="display: none">24. Termination</h2>
    <p><b>Termination.</b></p>
 
    <p>24.1 <b>Termination by You.</b> You may terminate your legal agreement with YouTube by terminating your access to and use of the YouTube API Services (including discontinuing access to and use by your API Client(s) and those acting on your behalf) at any time. You do not need to specifically inform YouTube when you stop using and accessing the YouTube API Services unless otherwise required by YouTube.</p>

    <p>24.2 <b>Termination by YouTube.</b> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, YouTube reserves the right to (i) suspend or terminate access to, or use of, any aspects of the YouTube API Services by you, your API Client(s) and those acting on your behalf), and (ii) terminate the Agreement (or any portion thereof), as applied to any specific user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients at any time. For example, we may need to exercise such rights in instances of your breach of this Agreement, court order, when we believe there to have been misconduct or conduct which may create potential liability for YouTube or its Affiliates. Although we will try to give you reasonable notice, we have no obligation to do so.</p>

    <p>24.3 <b>Effect of Termination.</b> Upon any suspension, notice of any discontinuance, or termination (whether by you or YouTube), you will immediately stop accessing and using all YouTube Property and delete all YouTube API Services (including all API Data) and YouTube Confidential Information in your possession or control, including from your servers. At YouTube’s request, you will certify your deletion of all YouTube API Services (including all API Data) and YouTube Confidential Information in your possession or control in writing that is signed by your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you. YouTube may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with credentials assigned to you or your API Client(s) to provide notice of both the suspension or termination of your access to, or use of, the YouTube API Services and the display of any advertisements associated with your API Client(s) (where applicable).</p>

    <p>24.4 <b>Termination of Support or Modification Efforts.</b> If YouTube elects to provide you or your API Client(s) with support or modification for the YouTube API Services, this support or modification may be suspended or terminated by YouTube at any time without notice to you, as applied to any specific YouTube API Services user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients.</p>

    <p>24.5 <b>No Obligation to Provide.</b> YouTube is under no obligation to provide the YouTube API Services. It is solely your responsibility at all times to be prepared to conduct your business and operate your API Client(s) without access to any aspect of the YouTube API Services.</p>
  
    <p>24.6 <b>Survival.</b> The following Sections of these Terms of Service will continue to apply indefinitely even upon any termination or expiration of the Agreement as applied to any specific user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients at any time: 1 (Definitions), 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (The Agreement), 3.3 (Permitted Access and Use of the YouTube API Services), 8 (Security) to the extent applicable data is in the process of deletion upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, 10.2 (Brand Features and Attribution), 13 (Publicity), 16 (No Implied Rights), 17 (Non-exclusive), 18 (Confidentiality), 19 (Exclusion of Warranties), 20 (Limitation of Liability), 21 (Indemnification), 22 (Injunctive Relief), 24 (Termination), and 25 (General Legal Terms).</p>

    <h2 id="general-legal-terms" style="display: none">25. General Legal Terms</h2>
    <p><b>General Legal Terms.</b></p>
 
    <p>25.1 <b>Entire Agreement.</b> The Agreement controls the relationship between you and YouTube and constitutes the entire agreement between such parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.</p>

    <p>25.2 <b>Third-Party Beneficiary.</b> Each Affiliate of YouTube is a third-party beneficiary under the Agreement and is entitled to directly rely on and enforce any right or benefit provided to it under the Agreement. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement.</p>

    <p>25.3 <b>No Waiver.</b> YouTube will not be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under the Agreement. A waiver will be effective only if YouTube expressly states in writing signed by an authorized representative that YouTube is waiving a specified term of the Agreement.</p>

    <p>25.4 <b>Severability.</b> If it turns out that a particular provision of the Agreement is found to be not enforceable, that provision will be modified by the court of competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary to create an enforceable provision that reflects the parties' intention as closely as possible. If that is not possible, it will be deemed deleted and the rest of the Agreement will continue in force unaffected.</p>

    <p>25.5 <b>Requesting Agreement Modifications.</b> You may grant approvals, permissions and consents to YouTube by email, but any modifications requested by you to the Agreement must be made in writing (not including email) and signed by both YouTube and your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you (and only if YouTube agrees to such modification).</p>

    <p>25.6 <b>Notices.</b> All notices to YouTube must be in the English language, in writing, and sent to our corporate headquarters address listed on our website via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt.</p>

    <p>25.7 <b>Assignment of the Agreement.</b> YouTube may transfer or assign the Agreement, including any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party, but you may not.</p>

    <p>25.8 <b>Relationship of the Parties.</b> You are not YouTube’s legal partner or agent; the parties are independent contractors.</p>

    <p>25.9 <b>Change of Control.</b> If you or any party operating your API Client(s) on your behalf experience a change of control (for example, through a stock purchase or sale, merger or other form of corporate transaction), you will provide to YouTube a written notice detailing the change of control within 15 calendar days after the change of control via <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/ytapiuserchangeofcontrol/">this form</a>. YouTube will review the completed form and if it is not approved within 45 calendar days after the change of control, your project ID will automatically terminate.</p>

    <p>25.10 <b>YouTube Approvals.</b> YouTube may deny or grant any consents, approvals, or permissions that are expressly contemplated under the Agreement or otherwise requested by you at our discretion.</p>

    <p>25.11 <b>Governing Law and Venue.</b> The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services. Subject to Section 22 (Injunctive Relief), all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., and you and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.</p>

    <p>25.12 <b>Limitation on Actions.</b> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE YOUTUBE API SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

    <p>25.13 <b>Translations.</b> Any local language translation (where applicable) exists for reference purposes only, and only the English version will be legally binding. If there is any inconsistency between the two versions, the English version shall control.</p>
